## Creating a new adapter

dbt can be extended with "adapter plugins." These plugins can be built into separate Python modules, and dbt will discover them if they are installed on your system. If you're interested in developing a new adapter plugin for dbt, please [open an issue](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/new) and be sure to check out the docs on [building a new adapter](building-a-new-adapter).
